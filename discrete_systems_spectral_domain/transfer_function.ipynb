    "## The Transfer Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Different time-domain representations are used to characterize linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete systems. For instance, the constant coefficients of [difference equations](../discrete_systems_time_domain/difference_equation.ipynb) and the [impulse response](../discrete_systems_time_domain/impulse_response.ipynb). The [transfer function](../discrete_systems_time_domain/eigenfunctions.ipynb#Transfer-Function) denotes the complex factor $H(z)$ an eigenfunction $z^k$ at the input of an LTI system is weighted with when passing through the system. Since the $z$-transform decomposes discrete signals with respect to these eigenfunctions, the transfer function constitutes a representation of an LTI system in the spectral domain (e.g. discrete (time) Fourier domain). The links between the transfer function and the time-domain representations of LTI systems are discussed in the following."

    "### Determination from Internal Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The transfer function $H(s)$ can be determined from the internal structure of an LTI system, if known. Either by derivation of the ODE characterizing the system, as shown above, or by direct analysis of the system in the Laplace/Fourier domain. For passive electrical networks this can be conducted by representing the signals and elements of the network by their complex impedances $Z(s)$ and applying Kirchhoff's circuit laws. This was illustrated for instance by the previous [Laplace domain analysis of a 2nd order low-pass filter](../laplace_transform/network_analysis.ipynb#Example:-Second-Order-Low-Pass-Filter). Similar procedures can be applied to other types of LTI systems, e.g. mechanical systems.\n",
