    "## Measurement of an Electroacoustic Transfer Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The propagation of sound from a loudspeaker placed at one position in a room to a microphone placed at another position can be interpreted as system. The system can be regarded as linear time-invariant (LTI) system under the assumption that the [sound pressure level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level) is kept reasonably low (e.g. $L_p < 100$ dB, **pay attention to your ears**) and neither the loudspeaker nor the microphone are 'overdriven'. Consequently, its impulse response $h(t)$ characterizes the propagation of sound between theses two positions. Room impulse responses (RIRs) have a wide range of applications in acoustics, e.g. for the characterization of electroacoustic equipment, room acoustics or auralization. Therefore their measurement and modeling by discrete systems has found a lot of attention in digital signal processing.\n",
    "Similarly, electromagnetic wave radiation between a transmitter and a receiver could be modeled as a linear transmission channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates how an electroacoustic transfer function can be measured and [modeled by an finite impulse response (FIR) system](transfer_function.ipynb#Modeling-a-Continuous-System-by-a-Discrete-System) using the soundcard of a computer. The module [`sounddevice`](http://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.org/) provides access to the soundcard via [`portaudio`](http://www.portaudio.com/). The basic procedure involves the following three steps\n",

    "1. generation of the measurement signal $x[k]$,\n",
    "2. playback of measurement signal $x(t)$ and synchronous recording of system response $y(t)$ (digitalization to $y[k]$), and\n",
    "3. computation of transfer function $H[\\mu]$ and impulse response $h[k]$."

Chirp signals show a variety of favourable properties for the measurement of electroacoustic systems, e.g. a low Crest factor and a magnitude spectrum which can be freely adjusted, for example to the background noise.\n",
