    "The response of an LTI system to the [Heaviside signal](../continuous_signals/standard_signals.ipynb#Heaviside-Signal) $\\epsilon(t)$ at its input is known as [*step response*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_response). It is defined as\n",

    "The step response characterizes the properties of a system when the input signal is 'switched on' at $t=0$. It can be related to the impulse response $h(t)$ of the system by\n",

    "The last equality can be deduced for instance by [graphical interpretation of the convolution](convolution.ipynb#Graphical-Interpretation). As the inverse operation to above integral is the derivative, this implies that the impulse response is the derivative of the step response\n",
