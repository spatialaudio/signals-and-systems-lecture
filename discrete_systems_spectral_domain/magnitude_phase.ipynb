In order to investigate the characteristics of an LTI system, often the magnitude $| H(e^{j \\Omega}) |$ and phase $\\varphi_H(e^{j \\Omega})$ of the transfer function are regarded separately. Decomposing the output signal $Y(e^{j \\Omega}) = X(e^{j \\Omega}) \\cdot H(e^{j \\Omega})$ into its magnitude $| Y(e^{j \\Omega}) |$ and phase $\\varphi_Y(e^{j \\Omega})$ yields\n",
