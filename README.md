# Signals and Systems 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture.svg?branch=ci)](https://travis-ci.org/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture)

This repository contains a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks providing notes and examples to the bachelors course [Signals and Systems](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Signal-und-Systemtheorie.428.0.html) read by [Sascha Spors](http://www.int.uni-rostock.de/Staff-Info.23+B6JmNIYXNoPWUxOTliMTNjY2U2MDcyZjJiZTI0YTc4MmFkYTE5NjQzJnR4X2pwc3RhZmZfcGkxJTVCYmFja0lkJTVEPTMmdHhfanBzdGFmZl9waTElNUJzaG93VWlkJTVEPTExMQ__.0.html), Institute of Communications Engineering, Universit√§t Rostock.

See [index.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb) for an overview. The notebooks contain computational examples written in [IPython 3](http://ipython.org/) which are best explored in an interactive manner. 

You are invited to contribute by reporting errors and suggestions as [issues](https://github.com/spatialaudio/digital-signal-processing-lecture/issues) or directly to [Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de](mailto:Sascha.Spors@uni-rostock.de).

## Getting Started

The Jupyter notebooks are available

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture/blob/master/index.ipynb)
* Online for [interactive use](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture/master?filepath=index.ipynb) using [binder](https://mybinder.org/)
* Local (offline) use on your computer 

For local use on your computer you need a local Jupyter/IPython installation. The [Anaconda distribtution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) provides a good starting point. You have to [clone/download the notebooks from Github](http://github.com/spatialaudio/signals-and-systems-lecture). Use a [Git](http://git-scm.org/) client to clone the notebooks and then start your local Jupyter server. For manual installation under OS X/Linux please refer to your packet manager.
