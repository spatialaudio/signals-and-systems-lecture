    "## The Transfer Function\n",

    "Different time-domain representations are used to characterize linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete systems. For instance, the constant coefficients of [difference equations](../discrete_systems_time_domain/difference_equation.ipynb) and the [impulse response](../discrete_systems_time_domain/impulse_response.ipynb). The [transfer function](../discrete_systems_time_domain/eigenfunctions.ipynb#Transfer-Function) denotes the complex factor $H(z)$ an eigenfunction $z^k$ at the input of an LTI system is weighted with when passing through the system. Since the $z$-transform decomposes discrete signals with respect to these eigenfunctions, the transfer function constitutes a representation of an LTI system in the spectral domain (e.g. discrete (time) Fourier domain). The links between the transfer function and the time-domain representations of LTI systems are discussed in the following."

For LTI systems these are composed from unit delays $z^{-1}$, multiplications and additions. From the analysis of the system structure, the linear difference equation can be derived. Once its coefficients are known it is straightforward to compute the transfer function $H(z)$. As alternative, the transfer function may also be derived by analysis of the system in the $z$-domain.
