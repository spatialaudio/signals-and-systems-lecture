    "The [phase and group delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_delay_and_phase_delay) characterize the phase and delay properties of an linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Both quantify the frequency dependent delay that is imprinted on a signal when passing through a system. In many applications the delay introduced by a system should be as small as possible or within reasonable limits."

The phase delay quantifies the delay of a single harmonic exponential signal $e^{j \\Omega k}$ with normalized frequency $\\Omega$ when passing through the system. The negative sign in the definition of the phase delay results in a positive phase delay $t_p(\\Omega) > 0$ when a signal is delayed by a system. Note, the phase delay may not be defined for $\\Omega = 0$."
